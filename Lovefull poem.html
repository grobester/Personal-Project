    <H2> Prologue </H2>
    <p>
   When the war of the beasts brings about the world's end
<br>The goddess descends from the sky
Wings of light and dark spread afar
She guides us to bliss, her gift everlasting</p>
 
     <h2> Act l</h2>
     <p>
 
    Infinite in mistery is the gift of the <br> godess we take it thus and take to the skies, ripples form on the waters surface. The wandering soul knows no rest.
    </p>
    <h2> Act 2</h2>
    <p>
    There is no hate, only joy
For you are beloved by the goddess
Hero of the dawn,<br> Healer of worlds
Dreams of the morrow hath the shattered soul
Pride is lost
Wings stripped away, the end is nigh
</p>
 
    <h2> Act 3</h2>
    <p>
    My friend, do you fly away now?
To a world that abhors you and I?
All that awaits you is a <br>somber morrow
No matter where the winds may blow
My friend, your desire
Is the bringer of life, the<br> gift of the goddess
Even if the morrow is barren of promises
Nothing shall forestall my return.
</p>
<h2> Act 4</h2>
<p>
My friend, the fates are cruel
There are no dreams, no honor <br>remains
The arrow has left the bow of the goddess
My soul, corrupted by vengeance<br>
Hath endured torment, to find the end of the journey
In my own salvation<br>
And your eternal slumber
Legend shall speak
Of sacrifice at world's end
The wind sails over the water's surface
Quietly, but surely
</p>
<h2> Act 5</h2>
<p>
Even if the morrow is barren of promises
Nothing shall forestall my return
To become the dew that <br>quenches the land
To spare the sands, the seas, the <br>skies
I offer thee this silent sacrifice.
